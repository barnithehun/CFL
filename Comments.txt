Comments on the empirical work: 

OVERHAULING WORK: 
 - must focus on external finance premia more - the results will be about this so I have to have some results about it as well

MAKE A REGRESSION FOR THE NEW OUTFLOWS OF DEBT!!!!!
LOOK AT THE PECKING ORDER REGRESSION
MAKE A PLOT OF THE CREDIT PREMIUM - do we want to match it? probably not because I disregard the probability of default channel which adds to the gradient of the loan rate curve
Box scatter plot for the u-shape
Probably, it is better to have a Pols, Reduced Pols and FE  setup - the firms level shit is confusing
Are there non-linearities in reliance on CF based lending and leverage? -- intuition is that it should pick up sharply after 0.6-0.7 when the debt cannot be fully collateralized anymore. Maybe just plotting is enough, maybe i should look into fixed effects regression.

Probably better to avoid equity financing in the model. May make the firms' problem easier but then you have to account for who holds equities and how shares work with firms. Not impossible, but probably non-negative dividends are easier.

Think about what happens when there are multiple lenders and some are asset based and some are cash flow based 
Have a good answer for priority 
	- see Lian and Ma, CF-based vs. asset based lending is NOT about priority, it is about the economic determinants of in-default payments
	- his problem was, what if there is a prioritized lender who comes in and takes the assets, then what happens to CF based lenders
	    the answer to this is as follows: the firm is either liquidated or reorganized, the lenders form expectations of the probability of these and hand out debt contracts accordingly

See who works on corporate lending and defaults at GSEFM and try to ask for a meeting 

Probably it would be interesting to see how the external finance premium changes for ABL and CFL debt contracts - what would be nice to see that it is ceteris paribus higher for ABL contracts 
 	- there is a part in this in Lian and Ma.
	- it would be interesting on a firm level - CFL reliance vs. the cost of external finance the firm faces

Certain firms could fully secure themselves with assets and with continuation value as well...
 - just assume that these firm have a CFL reliance 1-liquidation probability
 - this is at most 38% of all firms, but the true value must be significantly lower, cannot say much more as longs as I do not have the continuation values


 Maybe it is just enough to explain the U-shape in a PE model and be done with it...


Rewrite with, the firms is re-started under reorganization
