Technical summaries

Leo paper: 
 - No investment 
 - Endogenous insolvency from 2 elements: borrowing constraints and non-negativity of dividends
 - Incentive to save: to decrease probability of insolvency
 - Constrained vs unconstrained firms: 
      - The unconstrained firm has escaped the threat of insolvency forever
      - The constrained firm might not be threatened by insolvency now, but cannot save enough yet to escape this threat forever 
 - The dividend policy becomes the same as in KT13


KT13: 
 - No insolvency - Exogenous, uniformaly distributed quits
 - Capital investment
 - Partial irrevesibility of capital: (s,S) investment structure - not relevant for me
 - Constrained vs unconstrained firms: 
	- The unconstrained can invest optimally and keep enough savings to remain unconstrained forever
	- The constrained may be able to invest optimally but cannot keep enough saving to become unconstrained forever
 - Constrained and unconstrained have different dividend policy, no firm has to do the entire optimization for all 3 state variables
 

KT17: 
 - Endogeneous defaults - Endogneous borrowing constraint and non-negativity of dividends
 - Loan rate schedules depending on default probability 
 - Due to defaults: an extra class of firms who actually face default risk - they have to solve the complete optimization problem


Mine:
 - Endogneous voluntary exits from Kaas - if implemented, the cut-off rates as well
 - Stationary equilibrium characterization from Kaas
 - Loan rate schedules from KT17
 - Full firm classification from KT17
 - Uniform default probability from KT13
 - Added: Loan rate schedules depending CFL and ABL contracts

Model timing

T0 beggining

- Firms produce 
- The insolvency shock materializes

 In default, under asset-based debt contract: 
     - The lender liquidates the capital

 In default, under a 'hybrid' debt contract: 
     - The lender takes over the entire firm
     - It decides between liquidating or reorganizing
     - Reorganized firms are re-sold to the household
 
 No Default: 
     - Firms decide between continuing to the next period and exiting voluntarily
     - Quiting firms are liquidated and stop producing


- Entrants enter

- Continuing firms decide next periods' capital, debt and debt financings strategy given the interest rate schedule presented to them
