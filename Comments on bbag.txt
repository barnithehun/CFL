Marek on coding: 
 - You should write all equations first then the whole structure code in words..
 - Start with the simplest variation of your model - even something like and exogenous debt demand should do fine, just have a sensible CFL reliance
 - Even 3 states for the state variable is enough when you do a preliminary solution 
 - Use Julia, it is at least as fast as matlab - almost the same syntax just uses [] instead of ()
 - Parallelization only when your single core model runs perfectly
 - You can use matlab analytics to see how costly running each line of code is - only once you have a working code
 - Phyton codes Marek has send, in the corresponding paper they consider a lot cases and they have codes for it (*check the paper examples first)
 - Calibrating: you need to bring down your model solution time under around 20mins
 - Cluster: you can use it but you should first have working model first - parallelization is also needed here
 - You could try a model with just profits not continuation value
 - Probably, the best exercise would be to do THE OPTIMAL CFL RELIANCE IN JULIA

Comments on the presentation:
 - You should rewrite the Bellman with expectations
 - What kind of friction firms face? - is it that firms are inherently different or do they choose different debt financing strategies that leads to different credit frictions? 
 - Still need to further clarify the research question --- what kind of firm characteristics are we talking about?
 - Make the model slides more efficient, just focus on the details --- make a timing on firm values! - V0, V1, V2 timing on a timeline 
 - Why not have asset-based vs. CF-based
 - Should reproduce the U-shape makes people super interested usually
 - When you have a fixed costs you should have an extra min-max in there so that the V-zeta does not turn negative
