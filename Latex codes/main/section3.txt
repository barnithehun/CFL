\subsection{Default resolution frameworks \label{sec: default resolutions}}
When debt is secured against collateral, the lender expects to retrieve in-default payments by liquidating borrowers’ physical assets. The absence of such securities in case of cash flow-based contracts reflects creditors’ expectation that financial distress will be resolved through the reorganization of the borrower. Hence, asset-based debt contracts are consistent with liquidation, whereas cash flow-based contracts can be associated with the expected reorganization of the borrower.  \vspace{3mm} \\
However, the terms of debt contracts must be established ex-ante, whereas decisions concerning default resolution are made ex-post, only if financial difficulties arise. To better understand the determinants of creditors' expected, in-default payoffs under different debt contracts, it is worth discussing bankruptcy practices in more detail. In the following, I highlight some key characteristics of the US bankruptcy codes that will later inform the structural model. Appendix \ref{sec:A1} offers a more complete discussion of US bankruptcy procedures and also draws comparisons with the EU bankruptcy codes. \vspace{3mm} \\
\textit{a) The decision to reorganize or liquidate initially lies with the debtor, but lenders may enforce the conversion of the case under certain conditions.} Bankruptcy codes typically expect the debtor to first file for liquidation or reorganization - hence, the initial decision is in the hand of the debtor. Creditors may apply for the conversion of the default resolution, but this is approved only under special circumstances. Overall, the influence of a single lender over the default resolution is limited. Hence, unless the creditor deems that the probability of liquidation is zero, the terms of the debt contract must reflect the liquidation value of the borrower as well.\footnote{When the debt is secured against `substantially all assets', the lender becomes the owner of the entire corporate entity and it can make the liquidation decision himself. However, even in this case, the lender may find it more profitable to liquidate the company under certain conditions.}  \vspace{3mm} \\
\textit{b) Reorganizations must comply with the `best-interest-of-creditors' test.} This rule states that no dissenting creditor should be worse off under the proposed reorganization plan than it would be under the liquidation of the debtor. I refer to this principle as a basis to exclude scenarios in the structural model where asset-based borrowers undergo reorganization. In such cases, lenders can consistently expect to recover at least the liquidation value of the firm, making it unnecessary to consider this possibility when establishing conditions for asset-based lending. \vspace{3mm} \\
\textit{c) Special provisions to facilitate reorganization of SMEs}. Bankruptcy codes often attempt to alleviate the reorganization costs for small enterprises.\footnote{The EU directive allows member states to introduce special provisions to speed up and simplify the reorganization process for SMEs. The US bankruptcy code allow SMEs to file for a small business case (11 U.S.C. § 101(51C)) or under subchapter V of the Small Business Reorganization Act (SBRA), both of which are intended to streamline the reorganization process and reduce costs.} This is based on the recognition that these costs are often prohibitive for small enterprises. Despite the special provisions in place, SMEs are still far more likely to choose liquidation. I interpret this as evidence for the high fixed costs of the reorganization process. Continuing

\subsection{The fixed costs of lending against cash flows \label{sec:fixed costs}}
In the previous section, I emphasized that the empirical evidence points to substantial fixed costs of lending against future cash flows. This section identifies two possible sources of fixed costs: the costs of reorganization which materialize only under financial distress and monitoring costs that creditors must pay on an ongoing basis in order to maintain a realistic on the debtors' going-concern value. \vspace{3mm} \\
The reorganization process involves a lengthy negotiation between debtors, creditors, and courts, which imposes significant costs on the involved parties. When in-default payments are expected to be enforced via reorganization (i.e. when a cash flow-based contract is in place), the lender must take into account the legal, personnel and time expenses of this process. The costs of reorganization may fall on the debtor and the creditor as well. As I will illustrate later, the incidence these fixed costs is not relevant for the optimal external finance premium set by lenders. Lenders' expenses raise the costs of external finance directly, whereas firms' costs raises the probability of resolving default via liquidation, thus raising the costs of external finance indirectly. I summarize all fixed costs that materialize under the reorganization process with the parameter $\zeta_1$. \vspace{3mm} \\
Maintaining a cash flow-based debt contract may impose significant costs on the lender even in the normal course of business. Asset-based contracts only require occasional evaluations and audits of the borrower's assets. In contrast, cash flow-based contracts require that the lender carries out its' `due diligence' on an ongoing basis. The apparatus to maintain this monitoring activity may impose significant expenses for the lender.\footnote{This type of cost shares some similarities with the costly state verification first proposed by Towsend (1979). Although this concept had significant influence in the macro-finance literature, it is typically not mentioned in relation to cash flow-based contracts.} I summarize costs of CF-based lending, that materialize regardless of financial distress, by $\zeta_2$. More generally, this could be thought of as all additional expenses lenders face on a regular basis, when they deviate from standardized asset-based contracts. In the structural model, these fixed costs represent significant limitation in access to cash flow-based contracts. 



\subsection{Financial intermediation and loan rates \label{sec:loan rates}}
The decision to enter the cash flow-based borrowing market is a function of the inverse inverse rates, $q^{cfl}$ and $q^{abl}$ individual firms face. In this section, I discuss how these loan schedules are determined under the zero profit condition of the lender. 
The opportunity cost of lending to corporations is determined by the risk-free bond yields $q_0$. Lending to firms is subject to default risk. Hence, to break even, the lender must charge a premium on corporate lending. Since the probability of default is uniform, this premium depends only on the in-default payoffs and operational costs of the lender under each type of debt contract. Moreover, since defaults materialize one period after the lender sets the terms of credit, debt schedules are determined by future values $k'$ and $b'$ - and in the case of cash flow-based debt, by current productivity $\varepsilon$. 
\vspace{3mm} \\
Take asset-based lending first. When debt is secured a particular type of asset, the lender can enforce in-default payments by seizing and liquidating collateral. This lets the lender to keep monitoring costs low - for simplicity, I assume that these are zero for asset-based contracts. Moreover, these debt contracts provide a relatively quick and costless way to collect in-default payments. This allows the lender to keep the administrative expenses of resolving defaults at a minimum - again, I assume that these are zero for asset-based contracts. On the other hand, in-default payments are limited in the liquidation value of the collateral: a maximum of $\phi_k (1-\delta) k'$ can be retrieved from the borrower.\footnote{I assume that revenues realized within the period are also lost under involuntary liquidation.} Hence, for these contracts, the zero profit condition of the lender implies: 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:q_abl}
 q^{abl}(k',b')b' = \beta \left[ (1-P_\chi) b' + P_\chi \min\{b', \ \phi_k (1-\delta) k' \} \right]  
\end{equation}
Cash flow-based lending contracts allow lenders to retrieve the going-concern value of the borrower. In practice, the means of extracting the continuation value may differ depending on the debt contract that is in place. When debt is secured against the entire corporate entity or equity, the lender can directly obtain ownership in the firm. In his case, it may directly seize future cash flows. When the debt is unsecured, retrieving in-default payments is less straightforward, but it depends on the continued operation of the firm nevertheless. There are two reasons for this. First, the recovery rate of unsecured debt in liquidation is typically close to zero. Second, if the firm is reorganized, creditors payoffs depend positively on the continuation value of the firm. This mechanism is highlighted by Corbae and D'Erasmo (2021), who consider a Nash bargaining game for debt renegotiation. The threat of liquidation forces firms with high continuation value to agree to more generous terms of repayment. \vspace{3mm} \\
To keep the model parsimonious, I do not differentiate between these cases. In the following, I assume that when a cash flow-based debt contract is in place, the lender takes possession of the firm under financial distress and decides between liquidation and reorganization.\footnote{Although this assumption is not entirely realistic, it only affects the cases when lenders' and borrowers' decision does not coincide. In the model, this would never be the case because lenders and borrowers face the same reorganization costs.} In the case when it chooses liquidation, the lender loses the output it lent to the firm, but retrieves the collateral value after paying the variable cost of liquidation, $\phi_k$. In case of reorganization, the lender resells the firm to the household within the same period, at value $\phi_v V_2(k', b',\varepsilon)$ after paying the fixed cost of reorganization $\zeta_1$. Hence, the liquidation decision under default can be described as: 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:VD_1}
V_1^D(k,b,\varepsilon) = \max \Big\{ \phi_vV_2(k,b,\varepsilon)- \zeta_1, \  \phi_k (1-\delta) k - b \Big\}.
\end{equation} 
Seizing the reorganization value of the firm may allow more lenient credit conditions, but monitoring borrowers' expected future cash flows incurs an additional cost for the lender. Thus, the zero profit condition for the lender implies: 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:q_cfl}
q^{cfl}(k',b',\varepsilon)b' = \beta \left[ (1-P_\chi) b' + P_\chi \E \left[ \min\{b', \ V^D_1(k',b',\varepsilon')  \} - \zeta_2 \right] \right] 
\end{equation}
where $\zeta_2$ is the monitoring cost the lender must pay to estimate the continuation value of the firm - see section \ref{sec:fixed costs} for a detailed description of these fixed costs. Equation \ref{eq:q_cfl} characterizes the inverse gross interest rate given capital, debt and current productivity for a cash flow-based debt contract. Firms observe $q^{cfl}$ and $q^{abl}$ offered to them, and choose the debt financing strategy that maximizes their continuation value. This decision does not affect any current or future variables of the firm other than the current interest rate. Hence, the debt financing strategy can be isolated from the rest of the optimization: firms simply choose the strategy that yields the lowest interest rates. Let $q(x,\varepsilon)$ be the policy function for the optimal debt financing strategy. 
\subsubsection{Reliance on CF-based lending on the intensive margin}
As discussed above, $V_1^D(k,b,\varepsilon)$ can be the post-reorganization or the liquidation value of the firm, depending on which one is largest. Thus, even if the firm chooses to enter the market of cash flow-based credit, the lender must take into account that under certain conditions in-default payments reflect the liquidation value of firms' assets. Define the indicator function $\chi_1^D$ which takes on the value $1$ if the firms is liquidated under financial distress and 0 otherwise. Then, the probability of the borrower being liquidated under financial distress can be described as: 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:abl_share}
1 - \sum_{j = 1}^{N_\varepsilon} g_{ij} \chi_1^D(k',b',\varepsilon') = \text{CFL reliance}
\end{equation}
I associate this probability with the share of asset-based borrowing in firms' debt portfolio. This reproduces the observation that firms often hold asset-based and cash flow-based debt at the same time. \vspace{3mm} \\
In summary, the firm and the lender must agree on the terms of the borrowing contract before the realization of the idiosyncratic productivity (ex-ante). A firm can choose to only hold asset-based debt, in which case it faces $q^{abl}$. Alternatively it can enter the market of cash flow-based debt, in which case it faces $q^{cfl}$ and the share of asset-based debt is defined by the probability that the firm will be liquidated under financial distress, as defined in equation \ref{eq:abl_share}. Consequently, only firms that are never liquidated under distress hold purely cash flow-based debt portfolios in the model.
